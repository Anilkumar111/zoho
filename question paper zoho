    142857 × 4 = 571428
    142857 × 5 = 714285
    142857 × 6 = 857142

36. Sort the given dates

37. write a code to solve given mathematical expression
You are given a string that represent an expression of digits and operands. E.g. 1+2*3, 1-2+4. You need to evaluate the string or the expression. NO BODMAS is followed. If the expression is of incorrect syntax return -1.
Test cases:
a) 1+2*3 will be evaluated to 9.
b) 4-2+6*3 will be evaluated to 24.
c) 1++2 will be evaluated to -1(INVALID).
Also, in the string spaces can occur. For that case we need to ignore the spaces. Like :- 1*2 -1 is equals to 1.
